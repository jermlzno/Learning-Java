# Learning-Java
My first attempts at learning and writing Java programs

Hello All!
This is the beginning of my journey learning Java.
I am taking classes using Codecademy which so far has been very helpful in understanding the different parts of coding in Java.
I will be posting the small programs that they have me create just so that I can keep track of how the coding progresses and to keep track of my progress in my learning.
